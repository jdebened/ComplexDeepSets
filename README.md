# ComplexDeepSets
DeepSets extended to complex diagonal multiset automata

Code included to replicate our experiments.  
ICML-experiments.ipynb - Main code for digit summation experiments
ICML-unary.py - Code to generate unary automata and train our model on them
ICML-complexDiag.py - Code to generate complex diagonal automata and train our model on them

Much of the starter code and LSTM, GRU, and DeepSets baselines came from DeepSets repository.  Modifications have been made to some of that code, please refer back to their repository for the original version of their code.
